# Quantum Decider ⚛️🎲

> *"In another universe, you might've chosen the other option."*

A minimal web app that challenges the idea of determinism—by letting **true quantum randomness** make your decisions.

## 🧠 Concept

Most of what we do is deterministic. Even flipping a coin or rolling dice isn't truly random—they follow physics. But quantum mechanics? That's where things get weird.

This project uses **quantum-generated random numbers** from [ANU's Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) to help you make a decision—pure, unpredictable randomness.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌌 Decision-making powered by **real quantum events**
- 📡 Fetches live randomness from the **QRNG API**
- ⚡ Fast, lightweight UI using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**
