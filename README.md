# Quantum Decider ⚛️🎲

A hobby project to challenge the idea of determinism and explore true randomness.

### 🧠 Concept

Most of what we do is determined—even flipping a coin isn't truly random. That led me to quantum mechanics, where I found that photons *are* unpredictable. 

This site uses **quantum-generated random numbers** from the Australian National University's QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) to make a decision for you. For once, let randomness choose.

### 🤔 Why?

Because maybe—just maybe—this little moment wasn’t predictable. And that feels like a taste of free will.
